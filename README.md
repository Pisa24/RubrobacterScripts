# RubrobacterScripts
Complete account of the scripts needed to perform Rubrobacter analyses.
The scripts are described by a comment at the beginning, in both Italian and English. Each script requires its own directories and/or files. In every piece of code there is a comment indicating where you can insert such data.
Note: The scripts are not in workflow order. You can start with whichever one you find useful for your needs.
